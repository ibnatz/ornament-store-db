## Our tiny, affordable and slightly eccentric Ornament storeâ€™s database can track total money received from selling ornamental items in any month in a year. For example, we can easily see the total money earned from selling ornaments in September, 2024

This system basically models the Ornament Store's operations using MySQL, and is defined by:

+ Entity-Relationship Diagram

+ Clean implementation of Relational Schema

+ Normalized relational schema upto 3NF

+ Mapping tables and a correspondence table to ensure referential integrity and eliminate data redundancy
